              Semantic Data Interface Service -- SDIS/1.0
                          draft-cullen-sdis-00

Abstract

   The Semantic Data Interface Service (SDIS) is a protocol defining a
   unified method for Internet services to exchange machine-readable and
   human-readable data either publicly or privately to other services or
   user agents.  SDIS uses an input/output model of data translation
   between predefined formats in order to allow consistent communication
   between services or user agents without requiring each service or
   user agent to interpret the specialized APIs of others.  For example,
   this protocol could be employed by services or user agents to create
   "chains" of interfaces, allowing complex operations to be performed
   by connecting an output of a service to an input of another, an
   output of the second service to an input of a third, and so on.  The
   protocol could also be used in conjunction with, for example, a
   Bluetooth Low Energy-based protocol to refer mobile devices to SDIS
   interfaces depending on location in order to provide content for
   augmented reality systems.
